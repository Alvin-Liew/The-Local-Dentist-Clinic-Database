# The-Local-Dentist-Clinic-Database

## Project Milestone #1 Proposal

### Business Scenario:
Our company has ran a local dentist clinic in downtown Brooklyn. We have been keeping our records of patients, appointments, and payments using spreadsheets and log sheets. We would like to transition to a more efficient way of collecting data using a database.

In our business, we have different types of dental and orthodontic procedures such as teeth cleaning, fillings, restorations, tooth extractions, root canals, dentures, retainers, metal braces, gums care, etc. We need to keep track of materials (Dental equipment) used in the procedures. While each service has a standard price, insurance may affect the actual amount due to the patient. 

We also need to keep track of each patientâ€™s contact information as well as their insurance providers and dental history. We need to keep track of our employees including their home addresses, contact information, and pay rates. For appointments, we need to know the date and time of appointments and which patient the appointment is for.

### List of Entities/Attributes:
Appointment - Appointment_ID, appointment_time, appointment_date, Examination_Room
Patient - Patient_ID, Firstname, Lastname, street, city, state, zipcode, Phonenumber, Emailaddress, insurance, dental_history
Payment - 
Dental service - Dental service_ID, service_name, service_price, service_equipment
Employee/Provider - Employee_ID, Firstname, Lastname, street, city, state, zip code, Phonenumber, EmailAddress, Employee_Role, Paytype, PayRate, and PayTimePeriod
SpecificServiceRendered- SpecificServiceRendered_ID, Cost, Insurance_Coverage, Amount_Due

### Relationship Sentences:
One Payment History must be made by one and only one Patient 
One Patient may be making one or more Payment History
One Patient may be making one or more Appointment(s)
One Appointment must be a time set aside for one and only one Patient
One Appointment may be reserving one or more SpecificServiceRendered
One SpecificServiceRendered must be rendered during one and only one Appointment
One SpecificServiceRendered must be a rendering of one and only one Dental Service
One Dental Service may be rendered as one or more SpecificServiceRendered
One SpecificServiceRendered must be rendered by one and only one Employee
One Employee may be rendering one or more SpecificServiceRendered

##Project Milestone #3 Logical and Physical Modeling 

### Relational Model:
Appointment (Appointment_ID(Key), Appointment_Time, Appointment_Date, Examination_Room,Patient_ID(FK))
Patient (Patient_ID(Key), Firstname, Lastname, Street, City, State, Zipcode, Phonenumber, EmailAddress, Insurance, Dental_History)
SpecificServiceRendered (SpecificServiceRendered_ID(Key), Cost, Insurance_Coverage, Amount_ Due, Appointment_ID(FK), Employee_ID(FK), Dental_Service_ID(FK))
Dental Service (Dental_Service_ID(Key), Service_Name, Service_Price
Service_Equipment)
Employee(Employee_ID(Key), Firstname, Lastname, Street, City, State, Zipcode, Phonenumber, EmailAddress, Employee_Role, Paytype, PayTimePeriod)
Payment History(Payment_ID(Key), Payment_Date, Payment_Method, Payment_Amount, Patient_ID(FK))

### Functional Dependencies:

Appointment (Appointment_ID(Key), Appointment_Time, Appointment_Date, Examination_Room,Patient_ID(FK))
 FD1: Appointment_ID -> Appointment_Time, Appointment_Date, Examination_Room, Patient_ID(fk)

1NF: Yes, because it meets the definition of a relation
2NF: Yes, because all the non-keys are dependent on all the keys, no partial key dependencies 
3NF: Yes, there are no transitive dependencies

Patient (Patient_ID(Key), Firstname, Lastname, Street, City, State, Zipcode, Phonenumber, EmailAddress, Insurance, Dental_History)

  FD1: Patient_ID-> Firstname, Lastname, Street, City, State, Zipcode, Phonenumber, EmailAddress, Insurance, Dental_History 

  FD2: Zipcode-> City, State

1NF: Yes, because it meets the definition of a relation
2NF: Yes, because all the non-keys are dependent on all the keys, no partial key dependencies 
3NF: No, there are transitive dependices: PatientID-> Zipcode and Zipcode-> City, State, therefore PatientID ->City, State.  We need to split Patient into two new relations 

### NORMALIZATION:

Zipcodes(Zipcode(key), City, State)
FD1:Zipcode-> City, State

1NF: Yes, because it is split from a relation
2NF: Yes, because all the non-keys are dependent on all the keys, no partial key dependencies 
3NF: Yes, there are no transitive dependencies

Patient_1 (Patient_ID(Key), Firstname, Lastname, Street, Zipcode, Phonenumber, EmailAddress, Insurance, Dental_History)
	FD1: Patient_ID-> Firstname, Lastname, Street, Zipcode, Phonenumber, 
EmailAddress, Insurance, Dental_History 
1NF: Yes, because it is split from a relation
2NF: Yes, because all the non-keys are dependent on all the keys, no partial key dependencies 
3NF: Yes, there are no transitive dependencies

### DE-NORMALIZATION 

We need to return the relation Patient to its original form. 

Patient (Patient_ID(Key), Firstname, Lastname, Street, City, State, Zipcode, Phonenumber, EmailAddress, Insurance, Dental_History)


SpecificServiceRendered (SpecificServiceRendered_ID, Cost, Insurance_Coverage, Amount_ Due, Appointment_ID(FK), Employee_ID(FK), Dental_Service_ID(FK))
	FD1: SpecificServiceRendered_ID -> Cost, Insurance_Coverage, Amount_ Due, 	Appointment_ID(FK), Employee_ID(FK), Dental_Service_ID(FK)

1NF: Yes, because it meets the definition of a relation
2NF: Yes, because all the non-keys are dependent on all the keys, no partial key dependencies 
3NF: Yes, there are no transitive dependencies


Dental Service (Dental_Service_ID(Key), Service_Name, Service_Price
Service_Equipment)
	FD1: Dental_Service_ID-> Service_Name, Service_Price
Service_Equipment

1NF: Yes, because it meets the definition of a relation
2NF: Yes, because all the non-keys are dependent on all the keys, no partial key dependencies 
3NF: Yes, there are no transitive dependencies


Employee(Employee_ID(Key), Firstname, Lastname, Street, City, State, Zipcode, Phonenumber, EmailAddress, Employee_Role, Paytype, PayTimePeriod)
	FD1: Employee_ID->Firstname, Lastname, Street, City, State, Zipcode, Phonenumber, EmailAddress, Employee_Role, Paytype, PayTimePeriod
	FD2: Zipcode-> City, State 

1NF: Yes, because it meets the definition of a relation
2NF: Yes, because all the non-keys are dependent on all the keys, no partial key dependencies 
3NF: No there are transitive dependencies: Employee_ID-> Zipcode and Zipcode-> City, State, therefore Employee_ID->City, State.. We need to split Employee into two new relations 

### NORMALIZATION

Zipcodes(Zipcode(key), City, State)
FD1:Zipcode-> City, State

1NF: Yes, because it is split from a relation
2NF: Yes, because all the non-keys are dependent on all the keys, no partial key dependencies 
3NF: Yes, there are no transitive dependencies

Employee_1(Employee_ID(Key), Firstname, Lastname, Street, Zipcode, Phonenumber, EmailAddress, Employee_Role, Paytype, PayTimePeriod)

FD1: Employee_ID->Firstname, Lastname, Street, Zipcode, Phonenumber, EmailAddress, Employee_Role, Paytype, PayTimePeriod

1NF: Yes, because it is split from a relation 
2NF: Yes, because all the non-keys are dependent on all the keys, no partial key dependencies 
3NF: Yes, there are no transitive dependencies

The Appointment table is the master with Patient lookup and SpecificSevericesRendered as detail with a lookup for Dental Service and Employee. This form can be helpful when creating a bill for the customer or for insurance. The form has VBA code to convert First and Last Names to proper cases and a warning message that payment is needed immediately when the amount_due surpasses $5,000.

## Conclusion

Developing this project has really shown the importance of databases and the development lifecycle. Our project implements all of the important steps to create the perfect model of a database. As a group to build this database we used a variety of software and services that included text via WhatsApp to communicate and coordinate activities. We also used software such as google docs to keep all of the data for the project organized, and Microsoft Access to bring the project to life. Our experience with this project was nothing short of beneficial and help with real-world examples. Learning hands-on going into a computer-based industry is very important but this project gave you the tools and knowledge to begin in such an industry. I think the most difficult steps in this project came into play with the database implementation. Writing the SQL create table statement was very tedious, but this was a major part of the project. It took a lot of correct coding to make sure all data was stored in tables correctly, and showing the examples which showed why a database was required in the first place, was again a lot of necessary work. Although this was the most difficult for us we used our knowledge and what we have learned in class to complete these steps. One of the easier steps we considered was logical and physical modeling. This is the foundation of the project which makes it very important. It was very straightforward because this was the first time we listed all functional dependencies and created the E-R model into a relational model. We also found that this part of the project was the most interesting as you can see the relationship between entities for the first time. Participating in this project has nonetheless shown us the importance of having a database within a company. Without a database keeping track of all records, a company would not be able to run as smoothly and would face big challenges down the road. It's actually very interesting to see how older companies operated without such a system in place. In all, this project has taught us the importance of having the skills to create databases, as this is something that will always be in demand for the workforce, and if we had the opportunity to do anything different we would not. We struggled in some parts and made other parts longer and harder than they should have been, but by failing and committing trial and error we feel as if our skills in creating an entire database became better. To conclude, as a group we realized the benefits of creating a database, and the importance it holds on the society and workforce that we live in today.
